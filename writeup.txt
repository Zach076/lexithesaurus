2. Our program isn't meeting the efficiency tests sometimes. We assume -1 is a pipe error rather than a recoverable error. Given more time we would implement error checking and retry sends and recieves. 
3. We play-tested our program multiple times giving different inputs and testing edge cases. We continuously checked the athina script output to see what those tests found wrong with our program. 
4. The overall more complex game logic made for a more difficult assignment but we struggled specifically on how to implement turn timeouts.
